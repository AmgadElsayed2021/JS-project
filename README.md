# JS-project
for this project , i am creating an image slide plugin
the plugin will display all the images in a circleframe in the bottom of the page
the plugin will display  1 main image to the user
the plugin will provide to directions arrows for navigation between photos
the plugin will display a caption for each image
the plugin will provide navigation through the arrows or circle frames



/* requirements*/
all you need is to download the JS folder, CSS folder ,images folder and the index.html file.
in the JS folder you should find 2 js files (app.js   and    jquery.image-pop.js)
in the css folder you should find  styles.css file
in the images folder you should find 5 different images 
a jquery min link

/* installation*/
in the html file you will find the below elements:
Head element :- this is where you should like the css file. you will find the file in the css folder
body element:-
i divided this element into 2 parts:-
part 1 :- divided into 3 sections:-
  section 1 will have the image and caption part for each image in the below format
<!--           <div class="photo-slides"> -->
<!--             <img src="image link goes here"> -->
<!--             <p class="photo-caption">put the caption here</p> -->
<!--         </div> -->
  section 2 will have the navigation arrows
  section 3 will have a span  element where we will display a small image in a circular frame for each image in section 1 
  make sure that the images in section 3 are in the same sequence of the image in section 1
<!--             <span class="photo-slider-dots"><img src="image link goes here"></span> -->
  part 2:-
  this is where we eill connect the html to the ja files
  we will start with adding this jquery link :-
<!--         <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js""></script> -->
  then we must link the jqueryPlugin  file
  then the app.js file
  you will find the last 2 files in the js folder that you have downloaded from this repository.
